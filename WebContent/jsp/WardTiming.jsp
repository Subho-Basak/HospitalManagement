<h2>Maximum of two visitors per patient</h2>
<p>We request that visitors adhere to the visiting standards set by the Trust by making sure that no more than a total of 2 people visit their relative/friend within set visiting hours. This means that only TWO visitors are allowed to visit a patient during a single visiting time session.</p>
<p>If you need to visit a critically ill patient, or unable to visit within these times please contact the nurse in charge of the relevant ward via the hospital switchboard on 01244 365000 or speak to the staff on main reception who will provide assistance.  </p>
<br><br><br>
<h2>Protected Mealtimes</h2>
<p>Protected mealtimes are in place in so many areas of the hospital for patients and you may be politely asked to leave the ward until the protected meal time is over. </p>
<p>This initiative encourages wards to stop all non-urgent clinical activity during mealtimes. During this time patients can eat their meals without interruptions and nursing staff are available to offer help to those who need it.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Telephone calls</h2>
<p>Every hospital bed except in CCU.ITU and HDU has the bedside TV and telephone, patients can use this facility to both make and receive telephone calls.There are also public telephone kiosks in the main hospital corridor, in the Accident & Emergency Department and in the Women & Children's building.</p>
<p>Mobile phones may be used on the hospital site in waiting areas, entrance areas,entrance areas, restaurants and shops, and main corridors but they are not permitted to be used on ward areas by patients and visitors.</p>
